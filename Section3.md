## Articles
---

An article specifies if a noun is a definite thing or an indefinite thing.

In English this is demonstrated by `a/an, the`. Article `a` is used when the following noun begins with a consonant (a flower),
and `an` is used when that noun begins with a vowel (an icecream).

### Some Examples

* **The** flower - *there is **definitely** only one flower being talked about.*
* **A** flower - *we are talking about one of many flowers out there, it is **not definite**.*

In Hungarian the articles are `egy, a/az`. Article `egy` is indefinite (it is also the number one as well), whereas `a/az`.
Similar to English, `a` is used when the noun begins with a consonant and `az` with a noun beginning with a vowel (an icecream).

### Some Examples

* A kutya - *The dog*
* Az autó - *The car*
* Egy virág - *A flower*
