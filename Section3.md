## Articles
---

An article specifies if a noun is a definite thing or an indefinite thing.

In English this is demonstrated by `a/an, the`. Article `a` is used when the following noun begins with a consonant (a flower),
and `an` is used when that noun begins with a vowel (an icecream).

* **The** flower - *there is **definitely** only one flower being talked about.*
* **A** flower - *we are talking about one of many flowers out there, it is **not definite**.*

In Hungarian the articles are `egy, a/az`. Article `egy` is indefinite (it is also the number one as well), whereas `a/az`.
Similar to English, `a` is used when the noun begins with a consonant and `az` with a noun beginning with a vowel (an icecream).

* A kutya - *The dog*
* Az autó - *The car*
* Egy virág - *A flower*

### Spatial Postpositions
---

In English, there are prepositions. They dictate relationships between nouns. Here are some examples of spatial relationships.

* The bird flies *above* the city.
* The dog sits *next* to the girl.
* The man is *below* the bridge.
* The boy is *infront of* the building.

In Hungarian, there are postpositions. They are placed after the noun relationship instead of between. Here are the translations.

* A madár a város felett repül.
* A kutya a lány mellett ül.
* A férfi a híd alatt van.
* A fiú az épület előtt van.

These postpositions indicate a static relationship between the nouns, i.e. at that *specifc* point of time, they are not moving away from each other. Spatial postpositions can also represent the relationship of a noun moving towards the other noun or away from that noun.

| Postposition  | Moving towards (to) | Static        | Moving away (from) |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Next to       | Mellé               | Mellett       | Mellől             |
| Above         | Fölé                | Felett/Fölött | Fölül              |
| Below         | Alá                 | Alatt         | Alól               |
| Infront of    | Elé                 | Előtt         | Elől               |
| Behind        | Mögé                | Mögött        | Mögül              |
| Between/Among | Közé                | Között        | Közül              |

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Postpositions cannot be used with standalone pronouns, you have to attach the personal pronoun ending instead 
(this will be touched on in later sections). Here are some examples.

* István sat next to me.
  * ~~István én mellé ült.~~
  * István mellé**m** ült. (Sitting implies moving to sit somewhere, thus mellém is used instead of melletem)
  
* The man came out from behind you
  * ~~A férfi te mögül kijött~~
  * A férfi mögüled kijött.
