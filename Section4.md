## Plurals
---

In English, the plural form of a noun is generally given by adding an `-s` onto the end of a word, in Hungarian 
this is done by adding `-k`.

> Watch out! Some nouns end in `-k` in their base state (nominal). E.g. gyerek (child), játék (toy, game).

Naturally, when adding the plural to our nominal noun, we have to obey vowel harmony. Here's a collection of nouns.

| Noun                | -ak         | -ok           | -ek          | -ök            | -k          |

There's a lot to be taken away from here. We can make some rules, but **there will always be exceptions.**

* Some two-letter-long nouns lose the accent and get a `v` attached as well as a `k`
  * Fű - Füvek
  * Ló - Lovak
  * Kő - Kövek
  * Szó - Szavak
  * Tó - Tavak
* Most nouns ending in i only get a `k` attached.
  * Férfi - Férfik
  * Kiwi - Kiwik
* Most nouns ending in other un-accented vowels become accented in the plural.
  * Kutya - Kutyák
  * Macska - Macskák
  * Bögre - Bögrék (Mug)
* Most nouns ending in accented vowels only get a `k` attached.
  * Betű - Betűk (Letter)
  * Fiú - Fiúk
  * Író - Írók (Writer)
* Most nouns having an accent in the second syllable will lose it in the plural.
  * Madár - Madarak
  * Tehén - Tehenek (Cow)
  * Darázs - Darazsak (Wasp)

But wait! There's more!

In Hungarian, when a noun becomes quaintified (either by numbers or by adjectives) it becomes singular.

* Fák (trees)
* Két fa (Two trees)
* Sok fa (Many trees)
* Néhány fa (Some trees)

Finally nouns that usually come in pairs are considered singular.

* Zokni (socks)
* Cipő (shoes)
* Szem (eyes)

To single them out, one can describe them or use egyik (one of).

* A bal zokni (the left sock)
* Egyik cipő (one of the shoes)

## The Accusative Case (incomplete)

The Accusative case marks the direct object. Whenever something/someone does something to `something/someone else`, 
the `something/someone else` becomes the direct object. The Accusative case is simply marked with a -t at the end.

In English this only happens a few times. 

* Can you see me? (me is the direct object)
* Whom did you see? (whom is the direct object)

Látom a fát - I see the tree
Hallom azokat a madarakat - I hear those birds
Megettem a tortát - I ate the cake

This can be done in the format of questions

Mit csinálsz? What are you doing?
Kit látsz? Whom do you see?
Látod azt? Do you see that?
Etc

Note that if what you want to say is: I verb you then the verb takes the -lek ending and no object is required

Szeretlek - I love you
Látlak - I see you
