## Plurals
---

In English, the plural form of a noun is generally given by adding an `-s` onto the end of a word, in Hungarian 
this is done by adding `-k`.

> Watch out! Some nouns end in `-k` in their base state (nominal). E.g. gyerek (child), játék (toy, game).

Naturally, when adding the plural to our nominal noun, we have to obey vowel harmony.

*insert vowel harmony table here*

*v exception*
