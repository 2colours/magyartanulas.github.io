## The Infinitive (INCOMPLETE)

The infinitive form of a verb conveys a verb that has no mood, tense or relation to a noun.

In English, if you look up a verb in the dictionary, it will give you the verb in infinitive form. These verbs can be either preceded 
by `to`, succeeded by `ing` or not at all.

* I need *to go*.
* I like *playing* games.
* I must *leave*.

In Hungarian, the base-verb (taken from the 3rd person singular indefinite) is only succeeded by `-ni`. It also does not have any definite or indefinite conjugation.

* Szeretek *olvasni* - (I like to read/reading)
* Holnap tudok *menni* - (I can go tomorrow)
* Mikor foglak *l√°tni* - (When will I see you?)

When using the infinitive, be aware that the infinitive won't always line up with the base-verb. There are two cases:

**Case 1: Irregular verb**

The verb that you are using, could in fact be an irregular verb, in which case it has different conjugations (including infinitive form).
