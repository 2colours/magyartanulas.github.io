## The Conditional Mood (incomplete)

---

Up until now, we have been dealing with verbs in the indicative mood, i.e. verbs that *indicate* what is actually happening.

The conditional mood indicates what *would* happen if certain conditions are met. This can be seen all the time in English, with words like if and would.

* I would go if I had more time.
* Would you like to dance?
* Where would you guys like to go?

Naturally, there is more conjugation to represent the conditional mood in Hungarian.

Szeret (he/she/it likes). Keep in mind that there are many ways of expressing liking in Hungarian, we'll cover that later.

Csin√°l (he/she/it does/makes).
