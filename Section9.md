## Tetszik - General Interest In Things & People (incomplete)
---

To express general interest in Hungarian, you don't necessarily *like* something, but rather that something ***appeals*** to you. To achieve this, the verb `tetszik` is used in its base form (3rd person singular indefinite) and the dative case marks **who** it appeals to.

* Sok embernek tetszik az új film. (Many people like the new film. lit. The new film appeals to many people).
* Neked sem tetszik? - (Do you not like it either? lit. Does it not appeal to you either?)
* Nekem tetszik Éva. - (I have a crush on Éva lit. Éva appeals to me.)

The person who it appeals to can be omitted, from which context tells who that person is.

* Ennyi az egész, reméljük tetszett.
* Tetszik? Igen tetszik.
