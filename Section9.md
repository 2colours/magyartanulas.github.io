## Tetszik - General Interest In Things & People (incomplete)
---

To express general interest in Hungarian, you don't necessarily *like* something, but rather that something ***appeals*** to you. To achieve this, the verb `tetszik` is used in its base form and the dative case marks **who** it appeals to.

These are the relevant conjugations to express general interest, to see the full verb conjugation [click here!](https://cooljugator.com/hu/tetszik) Don't forget you can change past to past conditional by adding `volna`!

| Pronoun | Past indef. | Present indef. | Present indef. cond. |

| ő       | tetszett    | tetszik        | tetszene             |
| ők      | tetszettek  | tetszenek      | tetszenének          |
