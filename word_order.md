First, before we explain anything, let's clear up this misconception.

> Hungarian has a free order.

This isn't strictly true. While words can be rearranged, there are always exceptions.

## Neutral Sentences

### SVO

The default order for neutral sentences is **S**ubject**V**erb**O**bject (SVO). The subject does something (the verb) to the object. In English, personal pronouns or nouns are generally the subject.

* He kicked the chair.
* You threw the rock.
* The thieves stole my bag.
* György wrote his name in the sand.

In Hungarian neutral sentences, the subject is omitted if it is a personal pronoun. This is because the subject is implicitly stated in the conjugation.

* Rúgta a széket.
* Dobod a követ.
* A tolvajok ellopták a táskámat.
* György írta a nevét a homokba.

If there is no article, the order becomes SOV.

* Péter levelet ír. - (Péter writes a letter.)
* Hegyeket rajzolok. - (I'm drawing mountains.)
* Mindent akarok. - (I want everything.)
* Magyarul tanul. - (He's/She's learning Hungarian.)

Note the last one doesn't have a direct object, but the same logic applies.

If the sentence is describing something without verbs, (e.g. the ground is wet) the order becomes Adjective-Noun.

* Esik az eső.
* Kék az ég.
* Nagyon cuki a cicád.

## Emphasis

To place emphasis on a word in English, stress it. This emphasis can change the whole meaning of the sentence. Let's look at an easy example.

* ***I*** didn't give the book to her. - (Someone else gave the book to her.)
* I ***didn't*** give the book to her. - (No meaning changed.)
* I didn't ***give*** the book to her. - (I could have sold the book to her.)
* I didn't give the ***book*** to her. - (I gave her somethin else.)
* I didn't give the book to ***her***. - (I gave the book to someone else.)

Because English generally a rigid word order, emphasis only happens through stressing words.

Hungarian is a topic-prominent language. The topic (what the sentence is about) is placed at the beginning of the 

~~In Hungarian, the location of the topic in the sentence . As a rule of thumb, emphasised words (the topic) go before those that are not.~~

### Negation

The negative word always comes first when negating the sentence. The word directly after the negative word is emphasised.

* Nem vagyok magyar. - (I'm not Hungarian.)
* Nem magyar vagyok. - (I'm not *Hungarian.*)

Now the second sentence is incomplete. The emphasis has been placed on `magyar` which leads people to believe you are going to give them more information. Here are two ways you could complete the sentence.

* Nem magyar vagyok, hanem angol. - (I'm not Hungarian but (rather) I'm English)
* Nem magyar vagyok, de hülye sem. - (I'm not Hungarian, but I'm not stupid either.)
