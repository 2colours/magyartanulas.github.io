First, before we explain anything, let's clear up this misconception.

> Hungarian has a free order.

This isn't strictly true. While words can be rearranged, there are always exceptions.

## Neutral Sentences

### SVO

The default order for neutral sentences is **S**ubject**V**erb**O**bject (SVO). The subject does something (the verb) to the object. In English, personal pronouns or nouns are generally the subject.

* He kicked the chair.
* You threw the rock.
* The thieves stole my bag.
* György wrote his name in the sand.

In Hungarian neutral sentences, the subject is omitted if it is a personal pronoun. This is because the subject is implicitly stated in the conjugation.

* Rúgta a széket.
* Dobod a követ.
* A tolvajok ellopták a táskámat.
* György írta a nevét a homokba.

## Emphasis

To place emphasis on a word in English, stress it. This emphasis can change the whole meaning of the sentence. Let's look at an easy example.

* ***I*** didn't give the book to her. - (Someone else gave the book to her.)
* I ***didn't*** give the book to her. - (No meaning changed.)
* I didn't ***give*** the book to her. - (I could have sold the book to her.)
* I didn't give the ***book*** to her. - (I gave her somethin else.)
* I didn't give the book to ***her***. - (I gave the book to someone else.)

Because English generally a rigid word order, emphasis only happens through stressing words.

In Hungarian, the location of the topic in the sentence determines the emphasis. As a rule of thumb, emphasised words (the topic) go before those that are not.

### Negation

The negative word always comes first when negating the sentence. The word directly after the negative word is emphasised.

* Nem vagyok magyar.
*
