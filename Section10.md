## Locative Adverbs (incomplete)
---

Hungarian makes the distinction between where you are, where you are going and where you are coming from. We will be using these to help explain the locative cases.

| Where                 | Close             | Far                |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Hova? - Where to?     | ide - to here     | oda - to there     |
| Hol? - Where?         | itt - here        | ott - there        |
| Honnan? - Where from? | innen - from here | onnan - from there |

**Note:** `hová` is the alternative form of `hova`.

## The Locative Cases (incomplete)
---

There are nine cases that denote location relative to nouns, they are similar to the postpositions discussed in [Section 3](https://magyartanulas.github.io/Section3/).

These cases can be into three groups which are each applied to how the noun is interpreted.

* Hollow box
* Surface
* Solid

A noun can be interpreted in more than one way depending on the context.

### Hollow box
