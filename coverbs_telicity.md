## Coverbs

Coverbs are those things that add directionality or modify the meaning of the verb. Coverbs are so important that some of the verbs that use them change completely in meaning.

* You can *write down* some words for someone or *write up* words on the board.
* You can tell someone to *shut up* or *shut down* your computer.
* You can *turn on* your phone or *turn around* to see what's behind you.

This is the same deal with Hungarian so it's important to get these right. Here are some that you've seen in the previous sections as well as some more:

| Coverb | Meaning        |
|--------|----------------|
| fel    | up             |
| le     | down           |
| be     | in             |
| ki     | out            |
| át     | through/across |
| ide    | to here        |
| oda    | to there       |
| rá     | onto           |
| össze  | together       |
| haza   | towards home   |
| vissza | back           |

* Hazamegyek a családomhoz. - (I'm going home to my family.)
* A távoli fára rámutatott. - (He pointed to the distant tree.)
* Bekapcsoltam a számítógépet, aztán lekapcsolt a villany. - (I turned on the computer, then the power turned off.)
* Soha nem fog felnőni! - (He/She'll never grow up!)
* De miért idehoztad őt? - (But why did you bring him/her here?)
* A vonatablakból nem szabad kihajolni! - (Leaning out of the train window is not allowed (lit. not unrestricted))

**Special case:** Átláttam a szitán. - (I saw past the ruse)

Even though `át-` means through/across, when the noun has `-n` attached, the meaning changes slightly.
