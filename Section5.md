## Indefinite conjugation (incomplete)

In Hungarian, there is an important distinction between verbs, those that are transitive and those that are not.

A transitive verb is any verb that takes a direct object, i.e. the accusative.

* I *see something*
* You *brought something*
* He *read something*

In [Section 2](/Section2.md), we only covered intransitive verbs, these tend to be ones that show states of being or relations to nouns.
