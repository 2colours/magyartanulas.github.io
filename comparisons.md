## The Comparative and Superlative

In English, if you want to show that something is different to something else in some way, you use comparatives.

* It is slower.
* This is more comfortable to wear.
* My brother is taller than me.

And if you want to say that something is the best, no questions asked, then you use the superlative.

* We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!
* He is the fastest man in the world.
* That is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!

Naturally, Hungarian solves this issue with attachments.

To use the comparative, attach `-bb` to the end of a noun, and to make that comparative into a superlative attach `leg-` to the start of that noun. To go *even further beyond* we can attach `leges-` to exaggerate the superlative.

* Te vagy a legnagyobb hős a világon! - (You are the biggest hero in the world!)
* A szomszéd fűje mindig zöldebb. - (This is an expression: The neighbour's grass is always greener.)
* Ő a legeslegszebb lány számomra. - (She's the most beautiful girl for me.)

*Note: számára is a postposition, in this case számomra is more intentional than nekem.*

**BEWARE:** Some nouns will have their vowels shortened when attached. Here are some examples:

* szép - szebb
* jó - jobb
* kevés - kevesebb

## így/úgy

Both `így` and `úgy` are adverbial pronouns, i.e. both roughly translate into this way, or that way and thus go alongside verbs. Typically when `úgy` is used, it is followed up with more information either in the sentence or by context as it generally describes something that is distant. `Így` is used to follow up on something that is closer to the speaker, this is also done by context or in the sentence.

whereas `így` is used after . 

* Úgy többet tanulok, ha elmagyarázod nekem. - (I learn more (this way), if you explain it to me.)
* Úgy is jó. - (That way is good as well.) e.g. the way in which to do something.
* Így jobb. - (It's better like this/this way.) e.g. things are better since that thing has happened.
* Segítek neki, így gyorsabb lesz. - (I'm helping him/her, it'll be quicker this way.)
* Ugyanúgy gondolkoznak, ahogy én. - (They think the same way as I do.)

## ilyen/olyan

Both `ilyen` and `olyan` on the other hand are adjectival pronouns. They both translate roughly into this kind of, or that kind of and go alongside nouns instead. Similar to before, `olyan` is followed up with more information or context, while `ilyen` is typically closer to the speaker and the context or information is more obvious.

* Olyanok voltunk, amikor fiatalok voltunk. - (We were like that when we were younger.) e.g. talking about crazy kids.
* Olyan sok munkám van - (I have so much work.)
* Ilyen az élet. - (Such is (the) life.) 
* Ez lehetetlen ilyen körülmények között - (This is impossibe among such circumstances.)

*Alex: A házi feladat határideje tegnap volt. - (The deadline of the homework was yesterday.)

*Barnabás: Ilyen nincs! - (That can't be possible! lit. There is no such (thing))

## Mint

The word `mint` is used in linkage between nouns, when it is used with the comparative, it translates to than.

* Gyorsabb vagyok, mint egy golyó! - (I'm faster than a bullet!)
* Jobb adni, mint kapni. - (It is better to give than to receive.)
* Ennél nincs szebb a világon. - (There is nothing more beautiful in the world than this.)

As you saw, `mint` can be substituted for the `-nél,-nál` case.

*insert challnge **Az acél nehezebb a tollnál**

When `mint`is used with `olyan` or `úgy`, it translates to as.

* Ő olyan magas, mint én. - (He/She is as tall as me.)
* Az egyik olyan, mint a másik. - (One of them is like the other.)
* Úgy vezet, mint egy őrült. - (He/She drives like a maniac.)
* Úgy esik, mint a disznó! - (It is raining cats and dogs. lit. It falls like the pig!) 

*insert challenge, **mint te, olyan leszek!**
