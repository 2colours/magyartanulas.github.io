title: Introduction to Word Building

As you may have noticed already, Hungarian is an **agglutinative language**, it uses suffixes and prefixes to solve most of its problems. Part of this involves adding suffixes to words to create more words.

Note that if a suffix is added to a vowel, it gets lengthened, and there are some cases where nouns will be shortened.

Remember, even if you can see smaller words/root words within the word, the meaning may be completely different. For example:

| Word                         | Inverter               | Noun former            | Inverted noun                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Igaz (true)                  | igaztalan (untrue)     | Igazság (truth)        | igaztalanság (injustice)               |
| Boldog (happy)               | Boldogtalan (unhappy)  | Boldogság (happiness)  | Boldogtalanság (unhappiness)           |
| Tehet (he/she/it can do/put) | Tehetetlen (powerless) | Tehetség (talent)      | Tehetetlenség (powerlessness, inertia) |
| Zöngés (voiced)              | Zöngétlen (voiceless)  | Zöngésség (voicedness) | Zöngétlenség (voicelessness)           |

`Tehet` is actually `tesz` + `-het`, this is explained later at the conditional mood section.

This is scary and there are many more attachments, but as we move on to more sections, all the pieces will slide into place.
